Exploratory Data Analysis of Twitter Data using Python and its libraries.

The Project Scenario:

In this project, you will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at a social media agency, helping to create a comprehensive report that analyzes the performance of different categories of social media posts.

Suppose you work for a social media marketing company that specializes in promoting brands and products on a popular social media platform. Your team is responsible for analyzing the performance of different types of posts based on categories, such as health, family, food, etc. to help clients optimize their social media strategy and increase their reach and engagement.

They want you to use Python to automatically extract tweets posted from one or more categories, and to clean, analyze and visualize the data. The team will use your analysis to make data-driven recommendations to clients to improve their social media performance. This feature will help the marketing agency deliver tweets on time, within budget, and gain fast results.

Summary-
Accurate analysis of social media data is crucial for on-time posting and a better understanding of various content categories to reach a wide range of audiences and gain better overall results.

Solution-
My analysis revealed the significance of different categories on the post's reach and the audience's engagement with the post. We recommend our clients to post content of categories that have a better reach to the audience and therefore such categories have the potential to improve their presence on the platform.
By utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebook and incorporating external factors, I was able to improve the social media performance of our clients.

Approach-
I began by thoroughly examining and understanding the data, followed by cleaning and processing the data. I have utilized several visualization and statistical methods to derive my conclusion.
